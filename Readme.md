# Project 1: Digital Lock with Keypad and LCD
## By Russ Sobti, Armaan Oberai
### Description
This project uses a 4x4 Keypad and a 2-row LCD display to create a digital lock on the STM32 Nucleo microcontroller. 
The user can enter a 4-digit password using the keypad, and the LCD will display the password as it is entered. Pressing the pound key ```#``` will submit the password, and the LCD will display whether the unlock was successful or not. If unlocked, there is a menu where ```*``` can be entered to re-lock or ```#``` can be entered to set a new 4-digit password.
